Experimental validation of Dubins model based strategy to determine the optimal path of a Miniature Ground Vehicle (MGV), which is constrained by a bounded turning radius, that would enable it to run onto a given straight line, starting from an arbitrary initial position and orientation. The initial position and orientation is found out using image processing techniques. Then a modification of the  Dubins  path  method  is  used  to  obtain  the  complete optimal solution to this problem in all its generality using a computer. The   vehicle   will   be   getting directions   from computer and consequently follows the optimum path.
